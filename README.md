## Getting Started
  this is the first commit for the release branch of Expressionist!
  git clone, then, python version 2.7.10
  pip install requirements.txt (this installs flask, install yourself if you want to)
  python \_\_init\_\_.py
  navigate to the URL it instructs you to, and then you will be able to start coding actual grammars
  if you want to start contributing code or anything of that sort, please pull from master, this branch is designed to be minimized and easy
